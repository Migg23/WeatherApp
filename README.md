# Weather App Project
This is a weather project that utilizes the React framework and the Python web framework Flask. This app uses the meteo weather API to get the current temperature, the temperature for the next couple of hours, and the temperature for the next three days.



# How it's made: 
The project was created to allow myself to practice my python programming and also give me practice with React. Flask was used as the backend server, where the backend pulls information from the Meteo API depending on what is needed. Multiple functions are used to get the different temperatures, which are then sent as dictionaries. The React frontend can then pull from the Flask localhost and display the information. This project is still under development as the UX still needs improvement and features such as switching the display based on time.
